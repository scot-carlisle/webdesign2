                        <h1>About Us</h1>
                        <p id="p-about">After the failure of the first try, our team worked harder. They decided to go for it one more time. In the year 2011, we built our first and the official main branch of the House Smith in Santa Monica, Los Angeles. At that time, we knew the place was perfect for us since a lot of tourists visit Santa Monica on a regular basis. It is the center of tourism which makes it easier for us to zero into our target market. Many people really loved the drinks we make and gave us great feedback. We made sure that we keep making great dishes that everyone can enjoy whenever they visit us. The drinks are also well-made by our people and we are very proud of it.</p>
